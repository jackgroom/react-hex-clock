# Hex Clock in React

Inspiration for this project comes from [this website](https://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/).

This project is not finished, so expect bugs and unimplemented features (obviously).

### Planned features

[ ] Typewriter effect
[ ] Information on local weather
[ ] Information on daylight savings
[ ] CSS improvements (i am terrible at css)
[ ] Better string storage management

## Running the project

(taken from default README generated by create-react-app)

In the project directory, you can run:

### 'npm start'

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
